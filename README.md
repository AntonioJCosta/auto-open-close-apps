# Open-Close Apps

This project provides a simple way to manage Windows processes and applications, allowing you to terminate a specific process and start an application in the background, creating an `.bat` file whenever you want.

## Features

- Search for a running process by name.
- Terminate all instances of the specified process.
- Start an application in the background.
- Log application output and errors to files for debugging.

To run it, copy the `example.bat` file to a name of the application you want, and follow the instructions in the file.

After, just run your `.bat` file.
